                In addition, we're now opening up the developer meetings in order to deliver important content to the SU2 community. A significant portion of upcoming meetings will cover two new features: a spotlight discussion of a relevant SU2 topic led by one of the developers, as well as a Q &amp; A session during which the development team will answer pressing forum questions. Folks are encouraged to submit their questions and topics ahead of the meetings for inclusion on the <a href="http://www.cfd-online.com/Forums/su2">SU2 CFD Online forum</a>.

                <h4>Branching Model</h4>
                
                <p> This list describes the three types of branches on the SU2 repository. You'll want to pick the right one to work with, in order keep the merging process simple.</p>
                
                <ul>
                  <li> master -- stable, latest release and fixes </li>
                  <li> develop -- current development, generally the branch for you to start with </li>
                  <li> feature-* -- feature specific branches, check with the developer email list if you think this a better place to contribute </li>
                </ul>
                
                <div style="height:30px; width:100%"></div>
                
                
                <h4>Contributing Code</h4>
                
                <p> SU2 merges new code contributions through <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request">pull requests</a>.  As a new developer, you'll want to <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/">fork</a> SU2 to your personal account.  This creates a clone of the whole SU2 repository, branches and all, inside your github account.  Generally you'll want to start from the develop branch, but you can check with the dev-list if you think it would be more appropriate to work on a feature branch.  </p>
                
                <p> You can push all of your working changes to your forked repository.  Once you're happy with these, and want to push them to the origin repository, submit a pull request for your branch.  Make sure to pull any new changes from the origin repository before submitting the pull request, so that the changes can be merged more simply.  The senior developers will check out the changes, make comments, ask for some edits.  Then when everything looks good, your changes will merge into the main development branch! </p>

                <p> Below, you will find information regarding some important contributions that we believe are ripe for implementation in SU2 with a little help from the open-source community. We want to hear from any developers out there with an interest in tackling these topics or others (innovative ideas encouraged)!</p>

                <h3> 1) A Graphical User Interface (GUI) for SU2 </h3>
                
                <p>With so many available options, setting up a configuration file
                can sometimes be an obstacle to your analysis. SU2 would
                benefit significantly from a graphical
                interface to ease the creation and manipulation of
                configuration files. Some
                requested features for a GUI are:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Minimal use of external libraries (easy to
                    install).</li>
                  <li>Attractive, intuitive, and discoverable visual
                    design.</li>
                  <li>Easily adaptable to changes in the configuration file
                    format or options.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <div style="height:30px; width:100%"></div>
                
                <h3> 2) Expanded Support for the CGNS Standard</h3>
                
                <p>We believe that open data formats are important, and with that in
                mind, we would like to further expand our support for the
                <a href="http://cgns.sourceforge.net"> CFD General Notation System (CGNS)
                  Standard</a>. The current version of SU2 accepts CGNS
                unstructured, single-block meshes for input, and CGNS
                output is also supported, although these features could
                be expanded. For example, the current
                implementation generates a new file for output rather
                than writing solution data into the original CGNS input
                file. This would reduce disk storage, improve
                performance, and also make it easier to
                interface SU2 with other pre- and
                post-processors. Some ideas might be: </p>
                
                <ul>
                  <li>Implement an HDF5 based CGNS reader/writer.</li>
                  <li>Add full support for mixed-element and multi-zone unstructured meshes.</li>
                  <li>Streamline file I/O by reusing the original mesh file for solution output.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <div style="height:30px; width:100%"></div>
                
                <h3>3) Extended Documentation</h3>
                
                <p>Clear documentation is one of the most important features of the code,
                and it provides the fastest way to get up to speed with SU2.
                We would like your help improving the general documentation of
                SU2. In particular, we would appreciate contributions
                in the following areas:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Expanded tutorials: we would like additional tutorials that complement the existing set found in the web-based documentation. The tutorials can either detail and explain the functionality of SU2 (shape optimization, parallel computing, mesh deformation, etc.) or demonstrate general CFD knowledge (highlighting good meshes vs. bad meshes, the importance of CFL number, etc.). Tutorials are intended to be tools for teaching and learning, and they should follow the same style as the existing tutorials. They must provide any mesh or config files that are necessary for their completion. New or unique verification and validation cases would be of particular interest here. </li>
                  <li>Source code: help us increase the legibility of the SU2 source code either by providing further comments within the code or by highlighting code portions that are unclear. Specific additional comments (or wording changes) should be sent to us via GitHub pull requests. Those wishing to make requests for added clarity in particular source locations can use the github issue tracker. Please be specific on comment requests.</li>
                </ul>
