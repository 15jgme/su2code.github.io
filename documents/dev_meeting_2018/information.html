      <h2 class="text-center">Airports</h2>
      <p> <a href="https://www.glasgowairport.com">Glasgow International Airport</a> is the major Glasgow airport that connects GLA with other major cities in Europe and has also some flights to the US (not many though). There is another airport Glasgow Prestiwck (https://www.glasgowprestwick.com) but it not the best choice to get here, so please focus your travel plans towards GLA International. You could also reach Glasgow flying to Edinburgh EDI (https://www.edinburghairport.com) (slightly more connections there than Glasgow Int.)</p>
      <h2 class ="text-center">Connections between GLA and city centre</h2>
      <p><ol> <li><b>Shuttle bus</b> - the <a href="https://www.firstgroup.com/greater-glasgow/routes-and-maps/glasgow-airport-express">500 Airport express</a> bus connects GLA and the centre, the frequency is very high (about one ride every 10 min.) is costs £8 single ride, open return is £12. It’s a 15 min. ride to the centre. Depending on where you are staying you might want to drop off in the hotels quarter (Marriott, Hilton, etc.) or get to the city Centre (drop off at George square). It’s a purple bus and at the airport you could follow the signage for taxis, the bus stand will be there. You can buy the ticket right before boarding (card are accepted) or you can get the app (https://www.firstgroup.com/greater-glasgow/plan-journey/first-travel-apps) and get your tickets there.</li> 

        <li><b>Taxi</b> - classic option, taxi stand well marked upon exit of the airport (technically once you exit the restricted area of the airport go all the way left and you will get to the taxi stand.). A single ride is between £20-£25.</li>
        
        <li><b>Uber</b> - Nice and cozy. Same time (about 15 min.) to get to the centre, slightly less expensive than the taxi, i.e. £15-£20. The pick-up is not that close as the bus and taxi, but it’s at 2 min. walk from the taxi stand. You have to cross the road facing the Airport exit and go to the big building in front of the airport (it’s a parking and has the drop off area for private cars and Uber).</li> 
    </ol>
    </p>    
    <h2 class ="text-center">Connections between EDI and Glasgow city centre</h2>
    <p><ol> <li><bf><a href="https://www.citylink.co.uk/citylinkair.php">Bus</a></bf> - (the most convenient way), it’s a £12 for a single ride (£20 return) and in about 40 min. gets you to Buchanan Bus station (5-10 min. walk from George Square). The Airline stand is conveniently located right next to the exit of the Airport. You can buy your tickets on board (no card accepted, so you have to get cash).</li> 

      <li><b>Taxi/Uber</b> -  Not recommended, can be pricey, up to £50 single ride.</li>
      
      <li><b>Train</b> - You need to get to the Edinburgh train station taking either the bus, the tram or the taxi, and then you will get to Glasgow Queen street.</li> 
  </ol>
  </p>    
  <h2 class="text-center">Train stations</h2>
  <p>
    There are two main train stations: Glasgow Central and Glasgow Queen Street. Central is the main station that connects Glasgow with down south, e.g. London for example using the virgin train from Euston (about 4.5 hours ride, about £45). Both stations are very close to the city Centre (e.g. Queen street in facing George Square, while Central is 5-10 minutes walk). Queen street is the gateway to Scotland and connects for example Glasgow to Edinburgh (about 40 min ride) and Glasgow to the north (i.e. the wildings [cit.]).
  </p>
  <h2 class="text-center">In Glasgow</h2>
<p><ul>
   <li><b>City centre:</b>mainly George Square, Buchanan and Argyle Streets (the streets of shopping), the St. Enoch Centre and Buchanan Galleries (two shopping and food malls). There is a nice park called Glasgow Green with a botanic garden inside and nice pathways along the river Clyde (if you were following the European Championship this is where the cycling races where ending), the Glasgow Museum of Modern art and Strathclyde University.</li> 
   <li><b>West end:</b> mainly residential area but a few major attractions, i.e. Kelvingrove museum, Kelvingrove park, Kelvin hall (guess who these are named after), all around a river called “Kelvin”, Glasgow University. Byres road is a shopping street in the west end, but not at the same level as Buchanan or Argyle. The west-end is connected to the city centre by bus (there are many, like the number 3 or 75, 77, etc.) and it is an area where you can find a lot of nice restaurants (e.g. two fat ladies, the ox and finch to name a few). Otherwise you can walk there from the city centre (approx. 30 min. walk) along Sauchiell street (connected to Buchanan street) which has also some shops snd the closer you get to the west end has also some clubs.</li> 
   <li><b>Museums:</b> all museums in Glasgow are free, this includes the modern art museum (GoMA), the Kelvingrove and the riverside museum (the latter is still int he west-end and you can get there by taking the train from Argyle and leaving at Patrick and walking 10 minutes or by bus, the number 100). GoMA is modern art, so kind of futuristic installations, Kelvingrove is a mix of sculptures, pictures (including Dali’s artwork), animals and folkloristic Scottish items. Riverside is technological, with cars, motorbikes, trains and a tall-ship docked along the river Clyde.</li> 
   <li><b>Restaurant and pubs</b>: plenty of choices in the city centre and in the west-end, ranging from asian spicy food (indian-, japanese-, chinese-based) and western kitchen based on meat and fish. Popular Scottish food is Haggis (which sounds harsh in its description, but if you find it in your plate and you do not know what it is, actually tastes pretty good) and guess what: beer and whisky. ALE, pale ALE, Stout and companions are the most popular but you can find nice lagers (e.g. Innis and Gunn, Scheallion). I am not a whisky drinker so I cannot give nice advice on this (sorry..). Nice local breweries located in the city centre are: Tennents and Brewdog.</li>
