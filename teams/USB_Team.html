<p>Our group specializes in the development of <b>Residual Distribution</b> (also known as Fluctuation
Splitting) schemes and <b>unstructured shock-fitting</b> techniques. At present, we are <i>not</i> developing
SU2, but rather using it to perform code-to-code verification. We are particularly interested in assessing how different unstructured grid codes perform on purely triangular meshes. We might also consider interfacing our unstructured shock-fitting algorithm with SU2.
