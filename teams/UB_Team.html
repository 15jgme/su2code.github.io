                <p>The research activity focuses on the development of innovative computational fluid dynamics (CFD) codes and in the application of CFD to flow simulations of industrial interest. This activity is performed with both in house developed and commercial codes, which are mainly used for the analysis and design of turbomachinery (axial and centrifugal compressors, axial and radial thermal turbines, wind turbines).</p>
