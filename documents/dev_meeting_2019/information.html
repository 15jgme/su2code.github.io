      <p>Villa Monastero, a property of the Province of Lecco, is one of the most interesting attractions of Lombardy thanks to its strategic location, its history, its landscape and its environment. In addition, it offers a wide variety of services. The House Museum, the historical and noble residence, is at its core: in 2004 Villa Monastero was given the title of "Casa Museo" by the Lombardy Region, and since then its fourteen rooms can be visited following a charming itinerary.</p>
      
      <p>Villa Monastero is also an international Conference Centre where, in the year 1954, the Nobel prize winner Enrico Fermi held some lessons. The Villa offers rooms and facilities to hold meetings, conferences, seminars, training activities, workshops and cultural events in an unforgettable, beautiful setting.</p>
