                <p>The laboratory of Compressible-fluid dynamics for Renewable Energy Applications (CREA, <a href="http://crealaboratory.blogspot.it/">http://crealaboratory.blogspot.it/</a>) support theoretical, experimental and numerical investigations of compressible-fluid flows for renewable energy applications. Research activities include experimental work in the Test-Rig for Organic VApors (TROVA, commissioned in 2013), the design of the Supercritical CO2 for the PRocess Industry test-rig (SCO2PRI) and the development of a number of software tools for non-ideal fluid flows: the Fluidprop thermodynamic library (www.fluidprop.com), the dense-gas branch of the SU2 CFD solver , the PoliMIce suite for ice accretion, the code RGND for nozzle design in non-ideal conditions and the FlowMesh CFD solver (<a href="http://www.aero.polimi.it/flowmesh">http://www.aero.polimi.it/flowmesh</a>).</p>
