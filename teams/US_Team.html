<p>  The fluid mechanics group at the University of Strathclyde has extensive experience with the development and application of implicit Large Eddy Simulations, particularly for compressible transitional and turbulent flows, including turbulent boundary layers and turbulent mixing. Furthermore, the group is working on the development and application of multi-scale and molecular dynamics methods.
